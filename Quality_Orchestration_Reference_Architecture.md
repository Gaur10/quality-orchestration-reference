# A Reference Architecture for Quality Orchestration in Modern SaaS Systems

## Abstract
(Write 6–8 sentences. Focus on the problem, not the solution.)

## 1. The Problem with Test-Centric Quality Models
- Tool sprawl and fragmented ownership
- Pass/fail signals without context
- CI/CD pipelines optimized for execution, not decisioning
- Leadership blind spots despite growing automation

## 2. From Test Execution to Quality Signals
- Quality signals vs test results
- Leading vs lagging indicators
- Why aggregation matters more than coverage

## 3. Quality Orchestration: Conceptual Model
- Separation of execution and orchestration
- Signal producers
- Orchestration layer responsibilities
- Signal consumers

## 4. Reference Architecture
- Signal ingestion
- Normalization and weighting
- Policy-driven decisioning
- Feedback loops

## 5. Operating Model and Adoption Strategy
- Team ownership
- Incremental rollout
- What not to automate

## 6. Common Failure Modes
- Tool-first thinking
- Over-automation
- Metrics without ownership
- Local optimization vs system outcomes

## 7. Closing Thoughts
- Quality as a decision system
- Predictability over perfection
