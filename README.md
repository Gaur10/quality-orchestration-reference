# Testing at Scale: A Decision-Centric Model

This repository hosts a short perspective paper that examines why test-centric quality models break down at scale and proposes a decision-centric lens for rethinking quality in modern software organizations.

Rather than focusing on tools or implementation details, the paper explores how quality signals can be interpreted to support consistent, explainable release and operational decisions as systems and teams grow.

## Audience

This paper is intended for:
- Senior Engineers and Staff+ ICs
- Engineering and Quality Leaders
- Platform, Reliability, and Enablement Teams
- Architects responsible for release confidence at scale

---

## What This Paper Covers

- Why execution-centric quality models fail as complexity increases
- The distinction between test results and decision-ready signals
- A simple decision-centric orchestration model
- Why confidence, not coverage, becomes the limiting factor at scale

## Scope and Intent

This paper is intentionally conceptual. It does not prescribe tools, pipelines, or reference implementations, which are highly contextual and organization-specific.

Its purpose is to reframe how quality is understood and discussed at scale — not to exhaustively describe how it is implemented.
